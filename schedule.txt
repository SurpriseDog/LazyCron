# "Time" is the window is when the script is allowed to run. You can have multiple windows separated with commas.
# Example: 1-3am, 2pm-4m, 11:30-11:34 - Play around with these numbers, the system is very flexible. When you run my script it will show you the next time window available for each program.

# "Frequency" is how often the program. m = minutes, h = hours and so on. My script should allow most natural language inputs here. Time towards frequency is only counted when the computer is actively in use. Set as * and it will only run once a day.

# "Date" field is usually set as a range to limit it to run on certain days of the week:
# Example: m-f, every 2nd Thursday

# Use * for fields that you don't need to fill in.

# Requirements is a comma separated list of additional requirements needed for the script to run. Available ones are as follows:
#     idle    = Time the computer has been idle for
#     busy    = Computer must have been in use within time specified
#     plugged = Power cord must be attached
#     closed  = Lid must be closed
#     start   = Only run this many times at startup. 0 = infinite
#     elapsed = Computer must be used for a certain amount of time in day before running.
#     online  = Do we have internet access?
#     random  = Script will run randomly. Example: random 8h will (on average) run every 8 hours. Some days it will run 3+ times, other days not at all.




# A list of examples is presented below. The path in each example has a # before it to ensure it won't actually run.
# The columns are tab delimited, so it's better if you set your text editor to write actual tabs between columns. Spaces will also work with a minimum of 4 spaces between columns.
# Edit the above lines with your own schedule:

# Not sure if your schedule will work correctly?
# Run the program with the --testing option or just put a # before each script path to show what it would do.
